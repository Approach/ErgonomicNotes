#### The Mind Body Approach - Dr. John Sarno

 - The theory says that your mind is restricting blood flow to other parts of your body to deal with stress, for instance. Just the fact that people learn this is usually enough for them to stop their minds from doing this.

Diffuse RSI - Means they can't find a medical reason

http://tiledtext.com

(http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=421768)[For RSI - Thumb or Finger Trackball?]

http://henrikwarne.com/2012/02/18/how-i-beat-rsi/|great article with great comments

I had a bad RSI about 15 years ago with several sets of symptoms that
was not any of the tunnel syndromes. I finally got rid of it by
stopping working and going into poverty.

Before that I tried over 20 doctors, physical therapy, occupational
therapy, tie-chi, tens, stretching, exercise, rest, and all kinds of
pills. They altered the pain, but didn’t get rid of it. I probably had
several different problems, and that masked the arthritis that came on
later, until it couldn’t be hidden any more.

The state disability program is mostly good for creating stress and
anxiety.

There are a few things I still can’t do with my hands, but they’re
things I rarely do anyway, like using a scissors for over 10 minutes.
